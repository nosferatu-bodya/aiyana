                    And if you disagree with that, that means you're stupid and you should die. (i just remembered that
                    Aiyana said that she didn't like her name... so i didn't mean to say that Aiyana is stupid and that
                    she
                    should die, i meant that everyone who dislikes her name who is not she should die)

                <div class="whygreat-about">
                    Like i said, she spetializes on drawing disturbing things that have animal ears. She also draws epic
                    chessboards, doodles and tornados on the sides of her notebooks
                </div>
                <div class="whygreat-about">
                    She always replied to my letters fast, and never made up excuses, like me. And she's very
                    supportive. She was the first person to tell me that i'm amazing. And the first person who said that
                    they're pround of me was also her. I don't deserve such a good friend....
                </div>
                <div class="whygreat-about">
                    Whatever grass soup you've eatten before, it is horse shit comparing to Aiyana's grass soup. Once
                    you try it, you can't live without it anymore. It's just so beautiful... Probably... i've never
                    tried it :(. But i would gladly give my life for a single sip of that soup..
